# celeste-extractor
An asset extraction tool for Celeste!

Run using `python -m celex $celestedatapath`, after installing the dependencies.

Big credit to [briangordon's CelesteExtractor](https://github.com/briangordon/CelesteExtractor), the project I referenced to learn how to decode Celeste's `.data` files.
